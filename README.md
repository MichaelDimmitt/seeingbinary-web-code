My web code, with all the hidden stuff removed :)

The public code running my website... with all the hidden things retracted of course :)

an (almost) pure javascript site to emulate a linux terminal. the cool stuff is in includes. 

this was literally the first website i ever made, so the code is sloppy. im going back and making it more robust, but it takes time.
feel free to use this for your website, just include credits at the top of your index.html.

coming soon:

  *HTML5 local storage for creating files. with cd / nano support.
  
  *tab complete on commands and files.
  
  *more hidden stuff (contact me on irc if you are interested in seeing that)
